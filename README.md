- mini_git is a localized version of Git to track changes in a given file by saving changes made to the file when committing it instead of completely overwriting what was once saved

- search_engine is a file search engine in C++ developed by creating a text and MD parser to process a seed file, and developing a web crawler that performed depth-first search to determine the whole file database by utilizing incoming and outgoing links. 
  A Pagerank algorithm was implemented to optimize search results with “AND,” “NAND,” “OR” search criterion.

- map_coloring is composed of a binary search tree class that was written and that was extended to implement an AVL tree class (self-balancing BST) by utilizing inheritance and polymorphism. This AVL class was used to implement a backtracking/recursive solution to color a map with 4 colors only.
